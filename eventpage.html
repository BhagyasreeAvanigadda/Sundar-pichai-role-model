        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey & Company</p>
        
        <p>Pichai joined Google in 2004, where he led the product management and innovation efforts for a suite of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome and ChromeOS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. He went on to oversee the development of other applications such as Gmail and Google Maps. On November 19, 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of ChromeOS; the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 2011, and released to the public in 2012. On May 20, 2010, he announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google and introduced the new video format, WebM.</p>
        <p>On December 11, 2018, Sundar Pichai was questioned by the United States House Judiciary Committee on a range of Google-related issues such as possible political bias on Google's platforms, the company's alleged plans for a "censored search app" in China, and its privacy practices.[41] In response, Pichai told the committee that Google employees cannot influence search results. He also stated that Google users can opt out of having their data collected and that "there are no current plans for a censored search engine" in China</p>
        <p>In April 2024, after 28 Google employees were fired for protesting against Project Nimbus, Pichai stated that the office is not a place "to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics", and warned against using the company "as a personal platform".</p>
        <p>Pichai was one of several of the world's most powerful tech leaders to attend the second inauguration of Donald Trump in 2025.</p>
        <p>On 13 February 2025, under Pichai's leadership, Google responded to pressure from Donald Trump and Elon Musk to cease DEI initiatives by removing many annual American cultural events from Google Calendar, including Black History Month, Pride Month, and Holocaust Remembrance Day.[</p>
